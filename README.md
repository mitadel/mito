C++ software library for high performance simulations of complex multi-physics problems.

mito stands for **m**ath **i**nto **t**emplate **o**bjects: mathematical concepts are templatized 
and guide the design of the library using the newest C++ standards (>= 20).

Wherever possible the computation is resolved at compilation time, resulting in a very light and
efficient runtime.
