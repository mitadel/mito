# MiTo Code Documentation

MiTo uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) to generate the code docs directly from the source code.
The Doxygen output in XML format is processed into reStructuredText (.rst) using [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/)
and then built into the final HTML using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

## Requirements

- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/)
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
- [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/)

## Build Instructions

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
make html
```

The combined Sphinx/Breathe documentation is located in `build/html`. The standalone documentation generated by Doxygen can be found in `html/`.
